# SCQAP = Smart Contracts Quality Analysis Platform
SCQAP was created to facilitate the analysis of Smart Contracts from a Software Quality and Gas efficiency perspective. We have implemented a public repository of Solidity SC metrics accessible via a public REST API along with a web based client, where researchers can easily examine a massive number of smart contracts metrics with various charts and correlation diagrams.

You can find a SCQAP instance at <a href="http://195.251.210.147:8065/index.php">SCQAP</a>
